Problem A: Prime-Lover Mathematician
Problem Statement:
John is a mathematician who loves prime numbers. He has a habit of finding prime numbers in
everyday life. One day, he noticed that the number of students in his class is a prime number. He then
wondered how many different ways he can divide the class into two groups such that the number of
students in each group is also a prime number.
Write a program to help John solve this problem.
Input Format:
The input consists of a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the number of students in John's class.
Output Format:
Output a single integer representing the number of different ways John can divide the class into two
groups such that the number of students in each group is a prime number.
Sample Input 1:
7
Sample Output 1:
1
Explanation:
The only way to divide 7 students into two groups such that the number of students in each group is a
prime number is: {2, 5}. Therefore, the output is 1.



Problem B: Alice’s Love for Divisors
Problem Statement:
Alice is a math teacher who loves to play games with her students. Today, she has decided to play a
game called "Divisor Sum". In this game, Alice will give a number to her students and they have to
find the sum of all divisors of that number.
Alice is curious to know how many of her students can solve this game. She has asked you to write a
program that can help her find the answer.
Input Format:
The input consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the number for which Alice wants to find the sum of all divisors.
Output Format:
Output a single integer representing the sum of all divisors of the given number.
Sample Input 1:
10
Sample Output 1:
18
Explanation:
The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Therefore, the sum of all divisors of 10 is 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18.


Problem C: Jack and Jill
Problem Statement:
Jack and Jill are two math enthusiasts who love playing with numbers. They have two numbers a and
b, and they want to find their greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM). Can
you help them find it?
Input Format:
The input consists of two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) separated by a space representing the two numbers.
Output Format:
Output two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the GCD of the two numbers,
and the second integer represents the LCM of the two numbers.
Sample Input 1:
12 30
Sample Output 1:
6 60
Explanation:
The divisors of 12 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12} and the divisors of 30 are {1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30}. Therefore,
the greatest common divisor of 12 and 30 is 6.
The LCM of 12 and 30 can be found by multiplying the common factors once and then multiplying
the remaining factors. That is, LCM(12, 30) = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 60.


Problem D: Samantha’s Problem of Array
Problem Statement:
Samantha is a programmer who loves working with arrays. Today, she has given you an array of
integers, and she wants you to help her find the second smallest element in the array.
Can you help Samantha by writing a program to solve this problem?
Input Format:
The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), representing
the size of the array. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, . . . , an (−10^9 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9)
representing the elements of the array.
Output Format:
Output a single integer representing the second smallest element in the array.
Sample Input 1:
6
10 30 20 40 60 50
Sample Output 1:
20
Explanation:
The second smallest element in the array is 20.


Problem E: Alice in the String Land
Problem Statement:
Alice loves playing with strings. Today, she has given you a string S, and she wants you to find the
length of the longest substring of S which has no repeated characters.
Can you help Alice by writing a program to solve this problem?
Input Format:
The input consists of a single line containing a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5), where |S| denotes the length of the string.
Output Format:
Output a single integer representing the length of the longest substring of S which has no repeated
characters.
Sample Input 1:
abcabcbb
Sample Output 1:
3
Explanation:
The longest substring of S which has no repeated characters is "abc", which has a length of 3.
