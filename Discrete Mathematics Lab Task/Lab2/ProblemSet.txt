Problem A: Draw that Truth Table

Problem Statement:
Sifat is given a propositional logic. You need to draw the truth table giving the final value for all possible combination.
Input Format:
You’ll be given the propositional logic. There will be two variables. ‘a’ denotes “AND”, ‘o’ denotes
“OR”, ‘c’ denotes “CONDITIONAL”, ‘b’ denotes “BICONDITIONAL” and ‘n’ denotes “NOT”. All
characters will be separated by spaces.
Output Format:
Draw the truth table.
Sample Input 1:
(p a q) c (n p o q)
Sample Output 1:
T T T
T F T
F T T
F F T

Explanation:
p q (p a q) (n p) (n p o q) ((p a q) c (n p o q))
T T    T      F       T              T
T F    F      F       F              T
F T    F      T       T              T
F F    F      T       T              T

Problem A: Theory of Equivalence
Problem Statement:
Rizvi is given two propositional logics. You need to verify if both propositions are equivalent or not.
Two propositions are equivalent only if they have same outcome for all possible combinations.
Input Format:
You’ll be given two propositional logics. There will be two variables. ‘a’ denotes “AND”, ‘o’ denotes
“OR”, ‘c’ denotes “CONDITIONAL”, ‘b’ denotes “BICONDITIONAL” and ‘n’ denotes “NOT”. All
characters will be separated by spaces.
Output Format:
Print “Equivalent” or “Not Equivalent”
Sample Input 1:
n (p o q)
n p a n q
Sample Output 1:
Equivalent
Explanation:
This is the De Morgan’s theorem. Of course, they’re equivalent.


Problem B: সত্যবাদী যুধীষ্ঠির, ষ্ঠিরন্তন ষ্ঠিথ্যাবাদী এবং  িানুষ (Human)
Problem Statement:
In a forest, there lived three types of people: সত্যবাদী যুধীষ্ঠির (Truthful Yudhisthira), ষ্ঠিরন্তন ষ্ঠিথ্যাবাদী
(Eternal Lier) এবং িানুষ (Human). The first one always tells the truth. The second one always lies. The
third one sometimes tells the truth, sometimes lies.
Input Format:
You’ll be given one propositional logic.
Output Format:
If the outcome of the proposition is true for all possible combinations, print “Truthful Yudhisthira”. If
all outcomes are false, print “Eternal Lier”. Otherwise, print “Human”.
Sample Input 1:
p o n p
Sample Output 1:
Truthful Yudhisthira
Explanation:
If p is true, ~p is false. Therefore, p v ~p is true.
Again, if p is false, ~p is true. Therefore, p v ~p is true.
Hence, p v ~p is tautology. Therefore, the output is Truthful Yudhisthira.
